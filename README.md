# EmployeeApp
An React Native Based App to both hire and fire employees! Yay!

Companies can use to store details on an employee like name,position,salary,picture etc.
Includes camera access, uploading images,redux,working with node js and express as a backend.
Even includes features like how to crop pics for profile and even how to not hide content while keyboard is used.

Its assumable that you might want to copy.

So I'll leave the command lines here so you can install the node modules

npm install react-native-paper

Get your own API key from cloudinary and toss it here in the hashes:

https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/#######/image/upload

npm install @react-navigation/native

expo install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view

npm install @react-navigation/stack

expo install expo-image-picker

npm install ngrok -g


One teensey weensey bit problem:
That ngrok thing can host your server only for 7 hours. 
For a more permenant Use I recommmend Heroku.
